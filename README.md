## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

# Flutter CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This document explains how to set up a **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline for a **Flutter** project using **GitHub Actions**. 
The pipeline automates testing, building, and deploying the app for **Android, iOS, and Web**.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**
- A **Flutter project** hosted on **GitHub**.
- **GitHub Actions** enabled for the repository.
- (Optional) **Firebase/App Store/Play Store** credentials if deploying.

---

## **2. CI/CD Workflow Overview**
The pipeline includes the following stages:
1. **Code Checkout** â€“ Fetch the latest code.
2. **Setup Flutter** â€“ Install Flutter SDK and dependencies.
3. **Run Tests** â€“ Execute unit and widget tests.
4. **Build Artifacts** â€“ Generate APK (Android), IPA (iOS), and Web builds.
5. **Deploy (Optional)** â€“ Upload to Firebase Hosting, GitHub Releases, or app stores.

---

## **3. Setup GitHub Actions**
Create `.github/workflows/flutter-ci-cd.yml` with the following:

## **4. Required Secrets & Fastlane Setup**
ðŸ”‘ GitHub Secrets (Repo Settings â†’ Secrets â†’ Actions)
Secret Name	Description
GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT	Google Play JSON API key (Fastlane).
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY	App Store Connect API Key (Fastlane).
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT	Firebase Hosting service account.


## 5. How to use fastlane
ðŸš€ How to Use It?
In your terminal:

For Android (upload to Google Play Internal testing):
fastlane deploy_playstore

For iOS (upload to TestFlight):
fastlane deploy_testflight
